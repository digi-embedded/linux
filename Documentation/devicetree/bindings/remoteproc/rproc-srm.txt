Remoteproc System Resource Manager
----------------------------------

The remoteproc SRM (System Resource Manager) handles resources allocated
to remote processors.
This makes it possible for remote proc to reserve and initialize system
resources for a peripheral assigned to a coprocessor.

The devices are grouped in a core node

Core
====
Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-core"

Dev
===
Required properties:
- compatible: should be "rproc-srm-dev"

Optional properties:
- reg: register base address and length
- clocks: clocks required by the coprocessor
- clock-names: see clock-bindings.txt
- pinctrl-0: pins configurations required by the coprocessor
	The SRM reserves the pins for the coprocessor, which prevents the local
	processor to use them.
- pinctrl-names: must be "default".
- x-supply: power supplies required by the coprocessor
- interrupts: external interrupts configurations required by the coprocessor.
	This is optional since the configuration is done by the coprocessor.
	When defined, the SRM (over)writes the configuration which allows the
	interrupt controller to check for configuration conflicts.
- interrupt-parent: see interrupts.txt
- interrupt-names: see interrupts.txt

Example:
	system_resources {
		compatible = "rproc-srm-core";

		mmc0: sdhci@09060000 {
			compatible = "rproc-srm-dev";
			reg = <0x09060000 0x100>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&m4_pinctrl_mmc0>;
			clock-names = "mmc", "icn";
			clocks = <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_MMC_0>,
				 <&clk_s_c0_flexgen CLK_RX_ICN_HVA>;
			vdda-supply = <&vdda>;
		};

		button {
			compatible = "rproc-srm-dev";
			interrupt-parent = <&gpioa>;
			interrupts = <5 1>;
			interrupt-names = "gpio_key";
		};
	};
