title: NXP i.MX95 ISP Firmware loader

maintainers:
  - Robert Chiras <robert.chiras@nxp.com>

description: |
  The Camera domain from i.MX95 has an M0 core with an attached OCRAM, where a
  small code can be loaded and booted on M0. This driver handles the loading
  of the firmware binary, configuring the OCRAM and starting/stopping the core.
