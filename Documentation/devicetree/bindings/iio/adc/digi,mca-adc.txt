* Digi MCA ADCs of ConnectCore SOMs device tree bindings

The MCA ADC driver allows to read voltages from the MCA IOs that are ADC
capable. Check the MCA ADC-capable IOs on the specific ConnectCore SOM Hardware
Reference Manual.

Also, the ADC inputs can be configured as analog comparators. In this mode the
input is sampled periodically and an interrupt is generated based on the
comparison of the value with two thresholds. See the documentation for more
information on this feature.

Required properties:
- compatible : must be one of
    - "digi,mca-cc6ul-adc", for the ConnectCore 6UL internal MCA
    - "digi,mca-ioexp-adc", for the ConnectCore 6UL SBC Pro I/O Expander chip
    - "digi,mca-cc8x-adc", for the ConnectCore 8X internal MCA

Optional properties:
- digi,adc-ch-list: list of MCA IOs to be enabled as ADCs
- digi,comparator-ch-list: list of MCA IOs to be enabled as Analog Comparators
- digi,adc-vref: ADC reference voltage in uV, corresponds with the VCC_MCA
  voltage.
- digi,internal-vref:
  If this property is set:
     - Internal 1.2 V reference will be used.
     - The value in 'digi,adc-vref' will be ignored.
     - On the ConnectCore 8X version 1 this functionality is not available.
       Later versions of ConnectCore 8X have this functionality available and
       will force EXT_VREF pin to be configured as a 1.2 V output.
     - On the ConnectCore 6UL, this will force MCA_IO2/EXT_VREF pin to be
       configured as a 1.2 V output and a 100 nF capacitor must be placed between
       MCA_IO2/EXT_VREF line and GND for it to work properly.

Example:

	&mca_adc {
		digi,adc-ch-list = <0 4>;
		digi,comparator-ch-list = <3>;
		digi,adc-vref = <3000000>;
	};
