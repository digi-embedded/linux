Device tree bindings for Goodix GT9xx series touchscreen controller

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "goodix,gt1151"
				 or "goodix,gt5663"
				 or "goodix,gt5688"
				 or "goodix,gt911"
				 or "goodix,gt9110"
				 or "goodix,gt912"
				 or "goodix,gt927"
				 or "goodix,gt9271"
				 or "goodix,gt928"
				 or "goodix,gt967"
 - reg			: I2C address of the chip. Should be 0x5d or 0x14
 - interrupts		: Interrupt to which the chip is connected

Optional properties:

 - irq-gpios		: GPIO pin used for IRQ. The driver uses the
			  interrupt gpio pin as output to reset the device.
 - reset-gpios		: GPIO pin used for reset
 - AVDD28-supply	: Analog power supply regulator on AVDD28 pin
 - VDDIO-supply		: GPIO power supply regulator on VDDIO pin
 - touchscreen-inverted-x
 - touchscreen-inverted-y
 - touchscreen-size-x
 - touchscreen-size-y
 - touchscreen-swapped-x-y
 - reload-fw-on-resume  : Reload the touch controller configuration when re-
			  suming from suspend. This is required to allow
			  powering off the device during low power modes.
 - skip-firmware-request: Do not load the touch config through the kernel firm-
                          ware framework. Use the on chip configuration.

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* ... */

		gt928@5d {
			compatible = "goodix,gt928";
			reg = <0x5d>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
			interrupts = <0 0>;

			irq-gpios = <&gpio1 0 0>;
			reset-gpios = <&gpio1 1 0>;
		};

		/* ... */
	};
