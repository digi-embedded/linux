description: |
  Some QorIQ and Layerscape SoCs have an additional block on each SerDes
  networking lane, based on an IP core from MoreThanIP, which performs IEEE
  802.3 clause 73 base page exchanges (for auto-negotiation) and clause 72
  training frame exchanges (for link training).

  By default, this AN/LT block comes up with auto-negotiation disabled, and
  in that case it allows itself to be quickly bypassed from the data path and
  for the PCS link to come up without its involvement.

  Software can optionally make use of it, to turn the PCS, AN/LT block and lane
  (PMA/PMD) into a full copper backplane internal PHY.

  As a warning, this binding has not been peer reviewed, and may (and likely
  will be) subject to future incompatible changes. Also, the binding for the
  multi-lane link modes (40GBase-KR4) is not currently backed up by a driver
  implementation.

      The address of the AN/LT block within the internal MDIO bus of the MAC it
      is attached to.

      In the 1000Base-KX and 10GBase-KR link modes, the AN/LT block responds at
      the same MDIO address as the PCS (determined by the SGMIInCR1[MDEV_PORT]
      or SXGMIInCR1[MDEV_PORT] registers of the SerDes block, by default 0).
      The PCS and AN/LT block respond to different MMDs, though.

      In the 25GBase-KR and higher link modes, the AN/LT block responds at a
      different MDIO address than the PCS, determined by the
      ANLTnCR1[MDEV_PORT] register of the SerDes block. By default this is 4
      for lanes A and E, 5 for lanes B and F, 6 for lanes C and G, 7 for lanes
      D and H.

      The PCS responds in all cases at the address determined by the MDEV_PORT
      field of the SGMIInCR1, SXGMIIaCR1, E25GaCR1, E40GaCR1, E50GaCR1 or
      E100GaCR1 registers of the SerDes block.
