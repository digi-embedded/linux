  Common Feature Domains Controller bindings properties

  Domain controllers allow to divided system on chip into multiple feature
  domains that can be used to select by who hardware blocks could be accessed.
  A feature domain could be a cluster of CPUs (or coprocessors), a range of
  addresses or a group of hardware blocks.

  This device tree bindings can be used to bind feature domain consumer devices
  with their feature domains provided by feature-domains controllers.
  Feature omain controller provider can be represened by any node in the
  device tree and can provide one or more configuration parameters, needed to
  control parameters of the consumer device. A consumer node can refer to the
  provider by phandle and a set of phandle arguments, specified by
  '#feature-domain-cells' property in the device controller provider node.

  Device controllers are typically used to set the permissions of the hardware
  block. The contents of the feature-domains configuration properties are
  defined by the binding for the individual feature-domains controller device.

  Each node can be a consumer for the several providers. The first
  configuration of 'feature-domains' or the one named 'default' is applied
  before probing the device itself.

      Number of cells in a feature-domains controller specifier;
      Can be any value as specified by device tree binding documentation

      Indicates that the node is feature-domain-controller provider.

  feature-domain-names:
    $ref: '/schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string-array'
    description:
      A list of feature-domains names, sorted in the same order as
      feature-domains entries. Consumer drivers will use feature-domain-names
      to match with existing feature-domains entries.

    description:
      A list of feature-domains controller specifiers, as defined by the
      bindings of the feature-domain-controller provider.
