STMicroelectronics STM32MP1 Power Management Controller
=======================================================

The PWR IP is responsible for handling the power related resources such as
clocks, power supplies and resets. It provides 6 wake-up pins that are handled
by an interrupt-controller. Wake-up pin can be used to wake-up from STANDBY SoC state.

Required properties:
- compatible should be: "st,stm32mp1-pwr"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet
- interrupts: contains the reference to the gic wake-up pin interrupt
- interrupt-controller; Enable interrupt controller for wake-up pins.
- #interrupt-cells = <3>
- st,wakeup-pins: contains a list of GPIO spec describing each wake-up pin.

Optional Properties:
- pwr-supply: main soc power supply

Interrupt consumers have to specify 3 cells:
  - cell 1: wake-up pin id from 0 to 5
  - cell 2: IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
  - cell 3: Pull config: 0 = No Pull, 1=Pull Up, 2=Pull Down


Example:

	pwr: pwr@50001000 {
		compatible = "st,stm32mp1-pwr", "simple-mfd";
		reg = <0x50001000 0x400>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 149 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;

		st,wakeup-pins = <&gpioa 0 0>, <&gpioa 2 0>,
				 <&gpioc 13 0>, <&gpioi 8 0>,
				 <&gpioi 11 0>, <&gpioc 1 0>;

		pwr-supply = <&vdd>;
	};


Example of interrupt user:
gpio_keys {
	compatible = "gpio-keys";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	button@4 {
		label = "WakeUp4";
		linux,code = <BTN_4>;
		interrupt-parent = <&pwr>;
		interrupts = <3 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING 1>;
		wakeup-source;
	};
};
