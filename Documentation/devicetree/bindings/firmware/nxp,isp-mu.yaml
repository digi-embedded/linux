title: NXP i.MX ISP Firmware Communication Protocol

maintainers:
  - Robert Chiras <robert.chiras@nxp.com>

description:
The ISP firmware is a free-RTOS code running on M0 core inside the Camera
domain on i.MX95. Inside the Camera domain, there are multiple Messaging Units
used by the firmware in order to communicate with other cores willing to submit
jobs to ISP core.
This driver is using the mailbox system in order to send/receive messages to
and from ISP firmware.
It also provides the ISP firmware protocol used for communication with it.
