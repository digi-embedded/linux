description: |
  XM91080 designed for small and medium sizes of TFT LCD displays, is
  capable of supporting up to 1080RGBx2400 in resolution. It provides
  MIPI interface and is able to operate with either 2, 3 or 4 data lanes.

  FocusLCDs E55RB-I-MW346-C is 1080x1920, 4-lane MIPI DSI LCD panel
  which has built-in XM91080 chip.
