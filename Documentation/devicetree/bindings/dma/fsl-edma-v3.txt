* Freescale enhanced Direct Memory Access(eDMA-v3) Controller

  The eDMA-v3 controller is inherited from FSL eDMA, and firstly is intergrated
  on Freescale i.MX8QM SOC chip. The eDMA channels have multiplex capability by
  programmble memory-mapped registers. Specific DMA request source has fixed channel.

* eDMA Controller
Required properties:
- compatible :
	- "fsl,imx8qm-edma" for eDMA used similar to that on i.MX8QM SoC
	- "fsl,imx8qm-adma" for audio eDMA used on i.MX8QM
	- "fsl,imx8ulp-edma" for eDMA used on i.MX8ULP
	- "fsl,imx93-edma" for eDMA used on i.MX93
- reg : Specifies base physical address(s) and size of the eDMA channel registers.
	Each eDMA channel has separated register's address and size. The first one
	is Manage Page address space.
- interrupts : A list of interrupt-specifiers, each channel has one interrupt.
- interrupt-names : Should contain below template:
	"edmaX-chanX-Xx"
	     |     | |---> receive/transmit, r or t
	     |     |---> channel id, the max number is 32
	     |---> edma controller instance, 0, 1, 2,..etc

- #dma-cells : Must be <3>.
	The 1st cell specifies the channel ID, but source/event id on i.mx8ulp
	The 2nd cell specifies the channel priority.
	The 3rd cell specifies the channel attributes which include below:
	BIT(0): transmit or receive:
		0: transmit, 1: receive.
	BIT(1): local or remote access:
		0: local, 1: remote.
	BIT(2): multiple fifo case or not(only in Audio cyclic now):
		0: not multiple fifo case, 1: multiple fifo case.
	See the SoC's reference manual for all the supported request sources.
- dma-channels : Number of channels supported by the controller

Optional properties :
- power-domains : Power domains for edma channel used.
- power-domain-names : Power domains name for edma channel used.
- clocks : A list of phandle and clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry in
	clock-names. The first one is for Manage Page
- clock-names : A list of channel clock names.
- fsl,edma-axi : The bus type is AXI.

* DMA clients
DMA client drivers that uses the DMA function must use the format described
in the dma.txt file, using a three-cell specifier for each channel: the 1st
specifies the channel number, the 2nd specifies the priority, and the 3rd
specifies the channel type is for transmit or receive: 0: transmit, 1: receive.

Examples:
lpuart1: serial@5a070000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx8qm-lpuart";
	reg = <0x0 0x5a070000 0x0 0x1000>;
