title:  STM32 System Bus

description: |
  The STM32 System Bus is an internal bus to which some internal peripherals
  are connected. STM32 System Bus integrates a firewall controlling access to each
  device. This bus prevents non-accessible devices to be probed.

  To see which peripherals are securable, please check the SoC reference manual.
